# Forest_fire_detection
 - This Project Is To Implement Forest Fire Detection By Cnn .Used Basic Pretrained Model  To Train Real Life Image For Classification and Object Detection.
 - Libraries Used In This Project Keras,Matplotlib,numpy,Pandas,Computer Vision,Tensorflow,ImageIO.
 - This Model Has Achieved 98 % Accuracy By Training And Testing 
 - This Is the First And Basic version Of this Project 
 
 # Future Goals Regarding This Project
  1. Reducing Code Complexity -- As There Is Lots Of Lines Of Code Which is Hard To Understand
